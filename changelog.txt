Coverarts for week 1 and 2 were started on and only one song from week 2 needs a cover art
Start screen thing is done
Technically, we're done with week 1 except for dialogue, which is something we need to touch base on.

Oh yeah, we did some other QOL stuff with gf / bf animations (gf is sitting on R Lounge, bf
gets banned when he loses, etc.)


## [0.3.0] (08-14-2021)

###
This was supposed to be done a week later, but I'm procrastinating and don't really feel like
finishing insight cover art

All bgs are done (except for insight stage, but thats because I need to finish cover art)
Week 1, 2 and 3 animations are pretty much done
	Animator redid some of their idles and finished spotco idle. Just needs song 3 anim.

Week 1 Inst are kinda done
	Instrumentals are being redone + we got a vocalist so they can now send stuff out for 
	mappers to finish 
Week 1 Vocals are 95% done (last minute revisions from last updated instrumental)
Week 2 Inst are all done
Week 2 Vocals are 33% done
Week 3 song choice was completely changed so 25% Inst / 0% Vocals are done

2 songs are pretty much mapped and ready to be shipped out

Week 1 / 2 dialog are done and the dialog sytem is working :sunglasses:

Lots of programming stuff happened, like adding new weeks, bgs, characters, etc. into the game
Fixed broken animations (bf dead now centers the screen properly)


## [0.3.5] (08-29-2021)

###
Bro I feel bad for being impatient last week because a fuck ton of stuff happened

Everything art is done
Everything animation is done (just need extra dialog portraits)

Week 1 songs are all done and being mapped
Week 2 songs are 66% done (just need insight vocals)
Week 3 song insts are 50% done

Still only have 2 songs mapped, but a bunch of other songs have 1-2 maps

I was a dumb dumb and was trying to recompile the game by deleting the export file, but instead I deleted the source code so I had to start back at square one
	Shoutout to the entire team for not losing their shit and being understanding (bigger shoutout to Banana for letting me steal some of his code)
I have to add dialog system again :sob:
Adding a camera in rebeats fucks up every other song (bf sings dad's parts, dad sings bf's parts) so I have to re-add all the songs ingame. 
Weeks and songs have to be re-added

Made Week 3 Song 3 programming to my liking
Added extra bells and whistles (custom menu bg, robeats text / font)

I'm hoping this'll be the last update before we launch everything, fingers crossed y'all will love it. (edit: lol no)


## [0.4.0] (09-20-2021)

###
Omg its our first beta build its so cute. i kinda rushed it because one of our music producers is leaving to another country and we wanted to give him the build as a going away present.

I think all base programming is done and now its just dumb debugging

Week 1 songs are all done and mapped (we need some remaps)
Week 2 songs are the same as before
Week 3 song insts are all done and 25% of those songs have vocals 

We got all of week 1 charts done (I copy pasted alone hard for this build, but its fine)
Slow progress on week 2 / 3 charts

I haven't worked on the trailer animation stuff besides stair paralax, but I'm going to hivemind on that now. 


## [0.5.0] (10-20-2021)

###
Week 2 build is ready for team to QA test

Trailer is complete and ready to be uploaded

A lot of debugging was done, but we still got some more. Some QOL thingies were added like camera shakes and flashes

Week 1 and 2 songs / maps are done (need remaps)
Literally only Lemon Summer normal is the only week 3 song ready. Everything else is the same as last week.

Hopefully this comes out in November (I swear to god if I have to edit this)


##[0.6.0] (11-19-2021)

###
Week 3 Build is ready for team to QA test

Uhh I guess a modchart was worked on in terms of programming. Its about halfway done

Lots of promo art and video stuff designed already. We may just release the stuff when the mod releases.

Lots of remaps, but still need some edits. Edits are getting finalized though

Almost every single week 3 map was made. We just need freedom dive inst to add it into the game. 

OMG I think we can get this done in November
