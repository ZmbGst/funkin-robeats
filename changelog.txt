Coverarts for week 1 and 2 were started on and only one song from week 2 needs a cover art
Start screen thing is done
Technically, we're done with week 1 except for dialogue, which is something we need to touch base on.

Oh yeah, we did some other QOL stuff with gf / bf animations (gf is sitting on R Lounge, bf
gets banned when he loses, etc.)


## [0.3.0] (08-14-2021)

This was supposed to be done a week later, but I'm procrastinating and don't really feel like
finishing insight cover art

All bgs are done (except for insight stage, but thats because I need to finish cover art)
Week 1, 2 and 3 animations are pretty much done
	Animator redid some of their idles and finished spotco idle. Just needs song 3 anim.

	mappers to finish

Week 1 / 2 dialog are done and the dialog sytem is working :sunglasses:

Lots of programming stuff happened, like adding new weeks, bgs, characters, etc. into the game
Fixed broken animations (bf dead now centers the screen properly)


## [0.3.5] (08-29-2021)

###
Bro I feel bad for being impatient last week because a fuck ton of stuff happened

Everything art is done
Everything animation is done (just need extra dialog portraits)

Week 1 songs are all done and being mapped
Week 2 songs are 66% done (just need insight vocals)
Week 3 song insts are 50% done

Still only have 2 songs mapped, but a bunch of other songs have 1-2 maps

I was a dumb dumb and was trying to recompile the game by deleting the export file, but instead I deleted the source code so I had to start back at square one
	Shoutout to the entire team for not losing their shit and being understanding (bigger shoutout to Banana for letting me steal some of his code)
I have to add dialog system again :sob:
Adding a camera in rebeats fucks up every other song (bf sings dad's parts, dad sings bf's parts) so I have to re-add all the songs ingame. 
Weeks and songs have to be re-added

Made Week 3 Song 3 programming to my liking
Added extra bells and whistles (custom menu bg, robeats text / font)

I'm hoping this'll be the last update before we launch everything, fingers crossed y'all will love it.
