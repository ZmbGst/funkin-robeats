Spotco: ...
Spotco: It appears I've made a mistake.
Spotco: You... you aren't hacking.
Spotco: Fortunately
Spotco: My deepest apologies, I tend to get a bit out of control when it comes to my life’s work
Spotco: I'll restore your code... here.
Gf: Ahh, feels good to be free again!
Bf: Beep!
Gf: About the people who reported us, they probably were just Chris’ hyperfans
Gf: They were mad that he lost to Boyfriend.
Bf: Bip bap!
Spotco: I see. I’ll have to be more cautious in the future with who sends reports then.
Spotco: Sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. You're welcome in this city anytime.
Spotco: and if you want, that earlier offer is still on the table
Bf: Bleep bep!
Gf: Well, I think I had enough excitement for one day. What say we head home?
Bf: *eagerly nodds*
Spotco: Have a good day! Please come again soon!
Gf: You too!
Bf: *waves goodbye*
