Zombie wrote the intro text stuff because he was bored and is now writing all this explanation stuff because 
hes procrastinating

*fnf mod popularity makes some people think that other media originated from fnf as opposed to their original stuff
*Rhythm track was one of the inspirations for robeats
*I didn't feel like shading the week 3 bg so I made the intro text stuff lol
*terces sent an exact image of spotco we were using for concepting in another server and i thought I was in the mod 
discord so I almost sent a week 3 draft there

to start exploring fnf mod creation as a hobby
*Kabbu bugfables says don't do drug fables https://twitter.com/EllieSpec/status/1360783416707448833
*Explaining the roles of who did what in a general sense
*Riddle school phrase / inside joke as a throwaway line
*Visor and casual guitar originally gave +20/-20 ns, essentially cancelling them out. Also a reference to an original
concept for noob animations

*It's not every day someone downloads and plays something we make, so really, thank you for taking the time out of
your day to sit down and play our mod. We worked really hard on it and wanted to make it as good as we can, so we
hope you have as much fun playing it as we did making it.

*Bro don't set unrealistic expectations based on what you see on online media and compare yourself to that, you're
setting yourself up for failure. Look at your work and compare it to your past self, you'll be a lot more happy
and constructively critical over it.
*I realized this mod is basically that dumb youtube mobile game ad trend
*Same thing as the fnf / mnm discovery
*Before fnf came out, every person irl saw a rhythm game as "oh yeah, like guitar hero." I'm sure that'll change
in the near future

*I heard this lyrics video like when week 4 came out and I still remember the entire video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkEjCjKltkc
*A super cool channel I used to watch growing up. Their videos got privated as they represented something

*Whenever I'm drawing something, it only takes like 15 minutes of no distractions for me to "get in the
zone" and essentially blur out anything in the real world.
*sob I wanted to add so much more to BF's death animation but it was just SO BIG and the offsetting ruined
the entire sprite sheet so I had to trash everything for something basic.

*literally every single error when I was adding a new sprite sheet was because the xml files got fucked up
*I've hated programming for the longest time this and last year because its dumb, but im liking fnf modding programming
(probably because im not making stuff, but just editing it)
